1. Complete current Experiment 3 with existing version (for comparison)
  2. Update to YOLOv5 v7.0
  3. Re-run Experiment 3 with new version as "Experiment 3b"
  4. Document performance differences
  5. Use latest version for all Phase 2 experiments

  This approach gives us both comparison data AND the benefits of the latest version for the main research.

  Expected Timeline Impact: +2-3 days for setup and comparison, but -20% time for all future training runs.

  Research Value: HIGH - The reproducibility and performance improvements significantly strengthen the research
  quality.

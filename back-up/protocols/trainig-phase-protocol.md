1. Universal Configurations (applies to both phases)
   - Dataset preprocessing
   - Base hyperparameters
   - Evaluation metrics
   
2. Phase 1: True Baseline Protocol
   - Specific training commands (no augmentation)
   - Expected benchmarks
   - Testing on both clean and synthetic test sets
   
3. Phase 2: Environmental Robustness Protocol
   - Trial 1-5 specifications
   - Progressive augmentation strategy
   - Optimization guidelines
   
4. Model-Dataset Specific Protocols
   - YOLOv5n & VisDrone (Phase 1 → Phase 2)
   - YOLOv8n & VisDrone (Phase 1 → Phase 2)
   - [Continue for all combinations]

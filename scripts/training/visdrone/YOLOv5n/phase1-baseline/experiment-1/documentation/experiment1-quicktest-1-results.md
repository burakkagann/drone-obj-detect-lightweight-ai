  ‚ö†Ô∏è IDENTIFIED ISSUES

  1. Weather Testing Failure ‚ùå

  Problem: Script looks for exp2_phase2c but actual directory is exp2_phase2c_quicktest
  Impact: Unable to evaluate robustness to weather conditions
  Fix Required: Update get_phase_weights() method to handle quicktest naming

  2. Limited Training Duration ‚ö†Ô∏è

  Issue: Only 5 total epochs (2+2+1) insufficient for full potential
  Comparison: Experiment 1 used 50 epochs, achieving 0.0736 test mAP@0.5
  Impact: Cannot fairly compare progressive vs single-phase strategy

  3. Metrics Collection Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

  Problem: Phase summaries show null for final_metrics
  Cause: CSV parsing logic may have issues with column names
  Impact: Automated analysis incomplete

  üèÜ KEY ACHIEVEMENTS

  1. Successful Progressive Training: All 3 phases completed without errors
  2. Performance Improvement: 8% improvement over 5 epochs
  3. Configuration Robustness: Phase transition logic works correctly
  4. Experiment 1 Integration: Successfully used domain-adapted starting weights

  üîß RECOMMENDATIONS

  Immediate Fixes:

  1. Update weather testing script to handle quicktest directory naming
  2. Fix metrics parsing in phase summary generation
  3. Run full experiment (30+40+30 epochs) for meaningful comparison

  Analysis Improvements:

  1. Comparison with Experiment 1: Direct performance comparison needed
  2. Weather robustness testing: Critical for drone deployment scenarios
  3. Learning curve analysis: Plot training progression across all phases
